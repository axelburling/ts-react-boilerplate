# React + Typescript + Webpack 4 + LESS / boilerplate

## Things under the hood:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)

I've tried to keep things as simple as possible.

## Installation

1. Clone repository.
2. Run 'npm install' in the local copy (I hope you have NodeJS and NPM installed =)
3. Use one of:
   - `npm run build` for production build
   - `npm run dev` for development build (no minification)
   - `npm run start` for live server on `http://localhost:3030/`
   - `npm run storybook` for storybokk on `http://localhost:6666`
